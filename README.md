Merge Algorithm

This Python project implements a text classification system using a merge algorithm for feature sorting and Naive Bayes classification. The script processes text data, extracts features, and classifies the text into various categories.
Features

    Dataset Processing: Loads and preprocesses text data.
    Merge Algorithm: Custom implementation for sorting and counting text features.
    Naive Bayes Classifier: Utilizes Multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification.
    Accuracy Measurement: Evaluates classification performance using accuracy metrics.

Usage:
Run text_classifier.py to execute the classification process on your dataset. The script includes functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
