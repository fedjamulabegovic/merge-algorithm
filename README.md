# Merge Sort Implementation

# References
This project was developed as part of the course Data Structures 1 at TU Graz, under the guidance of Legenstein Robert.

## Overview
This project showcases an implementation of the merge sort algorithm within the context of text processing and classification in Python. The merge sort algorithm is used to efficiently sort data, which is a crucial step in feature extraction for text classification.

## Merge Sort Algorithm
- **Efficient Sorting**: Implemented merge sort, a well-known efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Application in NLP**: Used within the feature extraction process for Natural Language Processing (NLP), sorting textual data based on specific criteria.

## Key Learning Points for Software Development
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Understanding and implementing merge sort deepened my knowledge of algorithm optimization and efficiency.
- **Data Structure Management**: Gained insights into managing and manipulating complex data structures, essential for software development.
- **Problem-solving Skills**: Enhanced problem-solving abilities by applying a classic algorithm in a new context, demonstrating adaptability and innovation.

## Applicability in Software Development
- **Data Organization**: The skills obtained from implementing merge sort are directly applicable to any software development task involving data organization and management.
- **Performance Enhancement**: Understanding sorting algorithms like merge sort is crucial for improving the performance of data-intensive applications.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: The ability to implement and understand complex algorithms is vital for developing efficient and effective software solutions.

## Installation and Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with necessary libraries (`numpy`, `sklearn`, `nltk`).
2. The merge sort algorithm is the main focus of the script `merge_algorithm.py`.
3. Run the script `python merge_algorithm.py` to see the merge sort algorithm in action.
