# Merge Sort Implementation

# References
This project was developed as part of the course Data Structures 1 at TU Graz, under the guidance of Legenstein Robert.

## Overview
This project showcases an implementation of the merge sort algorithm within the context of text processing and classification in Python. The merge sort algorithm is used to efficiently sort data, which is a crucial step in feature extraction for text classification. The merge sort algorithm implemented in this project is used to sort a list of textual content by the frequency of each unique string's occurrence. It organizes the list in descending order, ensuring that the most frequently occurring strings are positioned at the beginning of the sorted list.


## Merge Sort Algorithm
- **Efficient Sorting**: Implemented merge sort, a well-known efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Application in NLP**: Used within the feature extraction process for Natural Language Processing (NLP), sorting textual data based on specific criteria.

## Installation and Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with necessary libraries (`numpy`, `sklearn`, `nltk`).
2. Run the script `python3 merge_algorithm.py` to see the merge sort algorithm in action.
